# WordFind game in RichMidia

This WordFind game has been adapted and improved for use within interactive media ads, where it is possible to change the difficulty level of the wordfind.

It works with two backgrounds where the first shows the words to be crossed out as you find them.

The words are in the background image but you also have the option to use them directly in the code, where in the CSS they are found as transparent, you just need to assign a color and they will appear. The same goes for the button, which is in the background but is also as transparent in the CSS.

Have fun and do not hesitate to contact me.
